# 'Wild Al' Bob
_This is a fork of a repository originally made by QuizzityMC_

A strange AI bot we got from following a strange tutorial, nicknamed 'Bob'.
Bob very often gives incoherent & questionable answers to simple questions. 
At times, it almost seems that he just scrapes answers off the internet and responds with the first thing he finds.
